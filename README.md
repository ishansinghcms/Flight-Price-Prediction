# Flight Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting flight prices based on various factors such as departure time, arrival time, date of journey, airline, duration, and number of stops. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical flight data and predict future prices accurately.

## Introduction

The aviation industry is dynamic, and flight prices can vary significantly based on multiple factors. Predicting flight prices accurately is crucial for travelers, airlines, and travel agencies to make informed decisions. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning model to predict flight prices with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain flight data containing various features such as departure time, arrival time, date of journey, airline, duration, and number of stops.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and extracting relevant features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among different features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Utilize machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Regression to train a predictive model on the processed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate its accuracy on a test dataset.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-time flight price prediction.
